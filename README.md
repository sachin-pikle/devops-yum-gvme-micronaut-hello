# Using Oracle GraalVM in OCI DevOps to build a Micronaut REST App

This sample shows how to use Oracle GraalVM in OCI DevOps build pipelines to build a simple Micronaut hello world REST application. You can use this approach to build any high performance Java application with Micronaut, Oracle GraalVM and OCI DevOps.

## What is GraalVM?

GraalVM is a high performance JDK distribution that can accelerate any Java workload running on the HotSpot JVM.

GraalVM Native Image ahead-of-time compilation enables you to build lightweight Java applications that are smaller, faster, and use less memory and CPU. At build time, GraalVM Native Image analyzes a Java application and its dependencies to identify just what classes, methods, and fields are absolutely necessary and generates optimized machine code for just those elements.

Oracle GraalVM is available for use on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) at no additional cost.

## What is Micronaut?

Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based framework to build modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. By avoiding runtime reflection in favor of annotation processing, Micronaut improves the Java-based development experience by detecting errors at compile time instead of runtime, and improves Java-based application start time and memory footprint. Micronaut includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation time making it a great fit for working with databases like MySQL, Oracle Autonomous Database, etc.

Micronaut uses GraalVM Native Image to build lightweight Java applications that use less memory and CPUs, are smaller and faster because of an advanced ahead-of-time compilation technology.

## What is OCI DevOps?

OCI DevOps services provide a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platform for developers to automate the build, test, and deployment of software applications on Oracle Cloud.

OCI DevOps build and deployment pipelines reduce change-driven errors and decrease the time customers spend on building and deploying software. The service also provides private Git repositories to store your code and supports connections to external code repositories. 


## Updating the Build Specification File

To install and use Oracle GraalVM in the DevOps build pipeline, update your build specification file as follows:

1. Add the following command to install the required Oracle GraalVM components. For example, this command installs Native Image along with the Java Development Kit (JDK) and other necessary dependencies.

    ```shell
    steps:
      - type: Command
        name: "Install the latest Oracle GraalVM for JDK 17 - JDK and Native Image"
        command: |
          yum -y install graalvm-17-native-image
    ```

2. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

    ```shell
    env:
      variables:
        "JAVA_HOME" : "/usr/lib64/graalvm/graalvm-java17"
    ```

3. Set the PATH environment variable.

    ```shell
    env:
      variables:
        # PATH is a reserved variable and cannot be defined as a variable.
        # PATH can be changed in a build step and the change is visible in subsequent steps.
    
    steps:
      - type: Command
        name: "Set the PATH here"
        command: |
          export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```

4. Build a native executable for your Micronaut application.

    ```shell
    steps:
      - type: Command
        name: "Example 2: Build a native executable with Oracle GraalVM for JDK 17 - Native Image"
        command: |
          ./mvnw --no-transfer-progress package -Dpackaging=native-image
    ```

5. The native executable file is available under `target/MnHelloRest`.

    ```shell
    outputArtifacts:
      - name: app_native_executable
        type: BINARY
        location: target/MnHelloRest
    ```

6. Package the native executable in a lightweight distroless runtime container image.

    ```shell
    steps:
      - type: Command
        name: "Package the native executable in a runtime container image"
        command: |
          docker build -f ./Dockerfile \
                    --build-arg APP_FILE=${APP_FILE} \
                    -t ${TAG} .
    ```

7. The runtime container image is available as a build output artifact.

    ```shell
    outputArtifacts:
      - name: runtime_image
        type: DOCKER_IMAGE
        location: ${TAG}
    ```

Here's the complete [build specification](build_spec.yaml) file.


## Build Logs

1. The `yum install` build log statements should be similar to:

    ```shell
    ...
    EXEC: Installed:   
    EXEC:   graalvm22-ee-17-native-image.x86_64 0:22.1.0.1-1.el7                             
    EXEC:    
    EXEC: Dependency Installed:   
    EXEC:   glibc-static.x86_64 0:2.17-326.0.1.el7_9                                         
    EXEC:   graalvm22-ee-17-jdk.x86_64 0:22.1.0.1-1.el7                                      
    EXEC:   libstdc++-static.x86_64 0:4.8.5-44.0.3.el7
